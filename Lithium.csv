7,CA00002,Geology,"The main borate deposit area lies between 350 m to 450 m below the current surface. The deposit comprises a sequence of mudstone and tuff. The borate mineralization occurs primarily as colemanite (2CaO 3B2O3 5H2O) in thinly laminated silt, clay and gypsum beds. In plan view, the concentration of boron-rich evaporites is roughly ellipsoidal with the long axis trending N40-50W. A zone of >5% B2O3 mineralization, ranging in thickness from 20 m to 68 m (70 ft to 225 ft), is approximately 600 m wide and 2,500 m long (Figure 4.3 in May 2017 Prospectus). Boron is believed to have been sourced from thermal waters that flowed from hot springs in the region during times of active volcanism. These hot springs vented into the Hector Basin that contained a large desert lake. Borates were precipitated as the thermal waters entered the lake and cooled or as the lake waters evaporated and became saturated with boron. Based on assay results, it appears if mineralization took place in several cycles, resulting in somewhat distinct mineralized horizons.",lithium; tungsten; salt; borax,-117.327,35.717
