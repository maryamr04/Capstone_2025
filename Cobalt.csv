Macroscopically, mineralization at Maturi Southwest is more or less identical to that found in Maturi (see Section 7.5.1) although it has a somewhat lower average grade of Cu, Ni, and PMs. Magmatic sulfide mineralization in the SKI is restricted to the BMZ and rarely occurs in the overlying PEG (including ultramafic) units and in the footwall granitoids. Sulfides are usually disseminated-patchy and interstitial to the host silicates. The most common sulfide minerals are chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, pentlandite, talnakhite, and cubanite which form irregular shaped patches consisting of multiple intergrown minerals. Bornite, covellite, and millerite occur in subordinate amounts and are products of late-stage differentiation of the crystallizing sulfide melt.",NA,NA,NA
45,MN00003,Geology,"The Maturi deposit consists of a tabular sheet of disseminated copper-nickel-iron sulfide mineralization 5 ft (1.5 m) to 865 ft (260 m) thick (average 215 ft (65 m)) in the BMZ which rests on or close to the SKI-granite contact. The mineralized zone is in, and immediately above, the footwall contact of the SKI. It consists of 1% to 5% disseminated chalcopyrite, cubanite, talnakhite, pyrrhotite, and pentlandite in a tabular zone, parallel to the contact. Better grades of copper, nickel and PGEs are associated with more mafic units located near the top of the BMZ, and there is excellent continuity of widths and values from hole to hole and section to section.",NA,NA,NA
46,MN00003,Geology,"Sulfides occur as disseminated interstitial aggregates, irregular blebs, partially oriented inclusions in feldspar, biotite and amphibole and as thin stringers in fractures and cleavages in silicate minerals.

47,MN00008,Geology,"The mineralization type within the 164 Zone (Fig. 7-8), which is located around 1.5 km S of the 138 Zone typically occurs as variable massive sulphide veins and pods < 2 m thick with blebby disseminated mineralization occurring at the base of FGO intrusion on the wall-rock contact (500 m depth), and often within hornfelsed and partially melted sediments near the chilled contact with the FGO. Mineralization is generally low tenor and has been interpreted as early cumulate mineralization associated with the base of the FGO. In the 164 Zone, the base of the FGO is more complex. Thick intervals of variable textured gabbro, magmatic breccia, and thin sills or dykes occur within the partially melted meta-sediment where coarse blebby disseminated mineralization occurs in variable textured gabbro with granophyric patches.",NA,NA,NA

In the 138 Zone, MZ type sulphides appear to form a wedge-like zone of 200 m length, 120 m to 160 m height and a width of approximately 50 to 90 m, starting at ~350 m depth.

49,MN00008,Geology,"The SMSU Zone forms the bulk of the defined mineral resource and occurs in the upper part of the CGO intrusion as an elongated boudin-aged tubular-shaped zone at the top of the CGO (Fig. 7-6). Two SMSUs (Upper and Lower) have been modelled. The Upper SMSU body dimensions are 400 m long, 40 m to 80 m wide and 40 to 70 m vertically at a depth of 300 m to 325 m. The Lower SMSU body dimensions are 350 m long, 40 m to 65 m wide and 40 to 70 m vertically at a depth of 445 m to 485 m. Within the SMSU Zone is a core of interstitial net textured sulphides (50% sulphides) (Figure 7-9). Surrounding the net textured sulphides are disseminated sulphides forming a peripheral halo decreasing towards the CGO margins. This halo has been shown to have elevated Cu and PGE tenors that could be used in targeting SMSU extensions. The SMSU appears spatially associated with the presence of the MSU, emplaced approximately 50 m below the MSU.

The MSU has a strike length of 550 m at a depth of 275 m (N) to 550 m (S). Close to moderately spaced drilling (35 m to 100 m) to test these massive sulphides suggests that they form southward plunging, pipe-like zones.

The host olivine cumulates visually resemble olivine cumulates of the FGO intrusion to the S and include intervals of quartz xenolith rich magmatic breccia similar to those in the 164 Zone. The 2017 drilling program has tested the extent of the FGO and mineralization in the area.

The deposit is a magmatic and hydrothermal ironcoppercobaltgold body that occurs largely within a highly altered, tabular syenite dike (Brandom, 1989; Hagni and Brandom, 1990; Kisvarsanyi, 1989), and is more closely related to the Olympic Dam IOCG deposit than any other Missouri iron deposit (Kisvarsanyi, 1989). The deposit consists of sulfide-bearing breccias, fracture fillings, and disseminations within the altered syenite dike and surrounding (intruded) trachytic and rhyolitic flows and tuffs (Kisvarsanyi, 1989). Possible structural control inferred by Kisvarsanyi (1989), involves a regional northeast-trending structural lineament that passes through the BossBixby magnetic anomaly. Kisvarsanyi also noted that the boundary of the syenite dike is difficult to define because large-scale assimilation, partial replacement, and contact metasomatic alteration has strongly affected the rhyolitic host rocks.

The disposition of the boxwork veins was controlled by original blocky jointing in the peridotite. Nickel occurs in all three layers of the blanket but is most abundant in the boxwork veins carrying garnierite. The darker green varieties of the garnierite contain the highest percentage of nickel. The nickel is believed to have been derived from olivine in the peridotite by decomposition during lateritic weathering, which probably took place during late Tertiary time, before the present regional surface at an elevation of 2,000 feet was dissected.
